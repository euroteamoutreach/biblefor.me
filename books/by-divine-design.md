Michael Pearl discusses some of the basic presuppositions that lead us to believe in and trust the unseen God. We are part of a great drama that is perfectly orchestrated by both the sovereignty of God and the free will of man.

Michael Pearl discusses questions that trouble many but few dare to ask.

"Why does God permit sin, sorrow, and suffering if He is who He claims to be?"

"Why did God even make us capable of sinning? If He knows all and is all powerful, couldn't He have created a world without sin and death?"

"Why did God create Lucifer if He knew it would result in sin?"

If you are philosophically minded, this book will appeal to you. If you are already a believer and would prefer some lighter reading check out the book [The Next Step](/the-next-step/).
