A King James Bible with a 200 page concordance and no other extras. If you want to study the Bible on your own and aren't afraid of combing through nearly two thousand pages you will find this Bible very helpful. Large print with very nice typography. Soft cover vinyl. 1757 pages.

If you do not yet trust in Jesus as your Saviour the [Good and Evil](/good-and-evil/) book will probably be more to your liking. If you are more philosophically inclined, checkout the book [By Divine Design](/by-divine-design/).
