If you have received the Lord Jesus Christ as your own personal Saviour, you made the most important decision of your life. To help you be more effective in your Christian walk, The Next Step will be most helpful. Though it is not meant to take the place of your Bible, it will teach you the basic steps to a strong and healthy Christian life.

If you do not yet trust in Jesus as your Saviour the [Good and Evil](/good-and-evil/) is probably a better read for you. If you are more philosophically inclined, checkout the book [By Divine Design](/by-divine-design/).
